Project Euler
=====

As an exercise, I think I might enjoy solving a few Project Euler problems.

My goal is to use JavaScript in a functional manner (no mutable objects).

I am not a mathemetician (at least, not a very good one), and mostly plan on solving the issues that can be solved with code, not intelligent math tricks.

I will use the [underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) library for handy functional programming tools.

At the moment, I do not have a JavaScript bigint library that I am using.
